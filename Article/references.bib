    abstractnote = {\&lt;p\&gt;Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has proven to be an efficient
    method for studying vocally active marine mammals in areas that are difficult
    to access on a year-round basis. In this study, a PAM recorder was deployed
    on an oceanographic mooring in western Fram Strait (78\textdegree{}50'N,
    5\textdegree{}W) to record the acoustic presence of narwhals
    (\&lt;em\&gt;Monodon monoceros\&lt;/em\&gt;) over a 3-yr period. Acoustic
    data were recorded for 14–17 min at the start of each hour from 25 September
    2010 to 26 August 2011, from 2 September 2012 to 11 April 2013 and from 8
    September 2013 to 27 April 2014. Pulsed and tonal signals, as well as
    echolocation clicks, were detected throughout the recording periods,
    demonstrating that this species is present in this region throughout the
    year. Generalized linear mixed-effect models showed a negative correlation
    between the acoustic presence of narwhals and very dense sea-ice cover
    (\geq{}90\%). Surprisingly, a positive correlation was found between the
    acoustic presence of narwhals and the presence of warm Atlantic Water in the
    area. Available data suggest that there might be a unique stock of narwhals
    in the Eurasian sector of the Atlantic Arctic that do not exhibit the
    ``traditional'' narwhal pattern of seasonal migration between coastal
    summering areas and offshore wintering grounds, but rather remain resident
    year-round in deep, offshore waters.\&lt;/p\&\#38;gt;

    abstract = {{Narwhals (\emph{Monodon monoceros L.}) occur in the Atlantic sector of the
    Arctic where for centuries they have been subject to subsistence hunting by
    Inuit in Greenland and Canada. Scientific advice on the sustainable levels of
    removals from narwhal populations provides the basis for quotas implemented
    in both Greenland and Canada. The scientific advice relies heavily on
    extensive aerial surveys that are the only feasible way to acquire data on
    narwhal densities and abundance throughout their range. In some areas lack of
    information on abundance, in combination with high exploitation levels, has
    caused conservation concerns leading to restrictions on the international
    trade in narwhal tusks. Narwhals also are regarded as highly sensitive to
    habitat disturbance caused by global warming. This study analyzed data from
    aerial sighting surveys covering four major narwhal hunting grounds in
    Greenland. The surveys were conducted as double observer experiments with 2
    independent observation platforms, 1 at the front and 1 at the rear of the
    survey plane. The sighting data were analyzed using mark–recapture distance
    sampling techniques that allow for correction for whales that were missed by
    the observers. The surveys also were corrected for animals that were
    submerged during the passage of the survey plane, using diving and
    submergence data from satellite-linked time–depth recorders deployed on 2
    free-ranging narwhals. The abundance of narwhals on the wintering ground in
    West Greenland in 2006 was 7,819 (95\\\% confidence interval [CI]:
    4,358–14,029). The abundances of narwhals in Inglefield Bredning and Melville
    Bay, northwest Greenland in 2007 were 8,368 (95\\\% CI: 5,209–13,442) and
    6,024 (95\\\% CI: 1,403–25,860), respectively. The abundance of narwhals in
    East Greenland in 2008 was 6,444 (95\\\% CI: 2,505–16,575). These surveys
    provide the first estimates of narwhal abundance from important hunting areas
    in East and West Greenland and provide larger and more complete estimates
    from previously surveyed hunting grounds in Inglefield Bredning. The
    estimates can be used for setting catch limits for the narwhal harvest in
    West and East Greenland and as a baseline for examining the effects of
    climate change on narwhal abundance.}
